Big data is interesting.

Download real time bus position data from bjgj.aibang.com:8899

1. Notify you when bus is going to arrive at the given station.
2. Analysis the bus position data to show the traffic flow.

You can get the old data here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rkdkjs5agw9klcc/iRZ5kU2pHD
I can't limit how you use this data. But I must say this data should be only used for researching, not bad thing.
Commercial using? If the data is opened to public by the government, I think you have the right to do this.

At last, I don't know whether the China government or the AiBang company are going to close this API or even encrypt it in the future.
